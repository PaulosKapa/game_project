#bugs:
	#bullet will disappear when gun is hidden
	#gun takes some time to dissapear when dropped
	#when the enemy target gets deleted, the game crashes
	#when the enemy ai needs ammo it doesnt take any magazines that are dropped before it entered the state
	#bullet too fast:
	#Is your raycast at least as long as the distance it travels in one frame?You could get the RigidBody's linear_velocity in pixels per second, divide that by your physics framerate and that's the length of the raycast
